## Document Upload Dialog Optimizations

### âœ… **Changes Made:**

1. **Button Text Simplification**
   - Changed from "ðŸ“„ Upload Documents + Google" to just "Documents"
   - Removed icons for cleaner, faster interface
   - Simplified user interaction

   - Load storage stats and formats immediately instead of in background
   - Setup UI immediately instead of delayed execution

3. **Dialog Configuration**
   - Disabled resizing for faster rendering (`resizable(False, False)`)
   - Force immediate update with `update_idletasks()`
   - Optimized dialog positioning

4. **Title Simplification**
   - Changed dialog titles from "Upload Document" to "Documents"
   - Consistent naming across all dialog types

- Simplified button text and removed unnecessary icons

### âœ… **Testing:**

- All optimizations tested and working
